Create a basic calculator program that performs mathematical operations on two integer values. The operation to be performed will be determined by a character input by the user.

Requirements:
Variable Declaration:

Declare two integer variables (e.g., num1, num2) to hold the numbers for the calculation.
Declare one character variable (e.g., operation) to specify the mathematical operation.
User Input:

Prompt the user to input two integers and store them in num1 and num2.
Prompt the user to input a character that represents the desired operation. For instance:
'+' for addition
'-' for subtraction
'*' for multiplication
'/' for division
Performing the Operation:

Based on the character input, perform the corresponding mathematical operation on the two integers.
Handle basic error scenarios, such as division by zero.
Output:

Display the result of the operation to the user.
