# Rust

![Rust](https://tweedegolf.nl/images/rust-101-logo.jpg)

Rust is a university course for computer science students at Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, introducing the Rust Programming Language, and is available for anyone who wants to teach Rust.

Why we have chosen Tweede Golf to prepare the course with us? Have a look at [blog post](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/80/rust-101-open-source-university-course) introducing the course.

This repo will contain everything that's needed to organize the course: slides, exercises, tools, setup instructions and more.

The rendered exercises, including installation instructions, can be found at <https://101-rs.tweede.golf>


## High-level goals

1. Deep dive, intermediate level Rust skill
2. Know the problems Rust aims to solve
3. Get practical, hands-on experience
4. Know why Rust features are the way they are
5. Ability to write custom CLI/server applications using popular crates or to contribute to existing projects
6. Ability to judge whether Rust fits project requirements
7. Ability to teach Rust to other people

## Suggested course schedule

The course is setup so that, after modules A1-A3, cherry-picking the modules that suit your purpose is possible.

When used in full 12-week format, the schedule is:

## About the project

Rust 101 aims to provide an open-source course, lectures, tutorials and exercises, that can be used by any higher education institution. In its entirety or by using bits and pieces to create your custom course.

The project was created for FIIT STU by Henk Oordt and others at [Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl).
